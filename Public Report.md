## 4. Open Issues & Risks

| ID   | Title                                                      | Priority |       
|------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| #162 | Edge‑case: zero‑volume assets causing divide‑by‑zero error | High     | 
| #171 | Improve logging for pre‑allocation pass                    | Medium   | 
| #178 | Validate Excel import for multi‑sheet files                | Low      

**Risks:**
- **Data Format Variability:** Inconsistent Excel templates may disrupt import—mitigated by stricter validation rules.  
- **API Rate Limits:** Multiple data sources could hit rate caps; plan to implement caching and back‑off strategies.  
- **Frontend Dependencies:** Delay in UI prototyping may push back user acceptance testing.
